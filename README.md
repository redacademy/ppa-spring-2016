<h1>Planet Protector Academy Website</h1>
<h5>created by: Claudine Bananal, Billy Tam, Kyle Minchin</h5>


<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>For the final project at Red Academy we built real world websites for community clients. The Planet Protector Academy website was designed by the UX students at Red Academy. A mobile first responsive Wordpress CMS website was created by the web development group (Claudine, Kyle, Billy).</p>

<p>The website was created using a mobile first approach, meaning that the mobile version of the website is designed first, and then additional CSS is written to create a desktop version when the screen size increases. </p>

<p>The backend of the website was setup so that the client can access and make changes to the website without coding knowledge. The CMS was also setup so that the client can do minimal damage to the website from the back end. This is to prevent the client from accidentally deleting something and bringing down the entire website by mistake. </p>

<h4>Technical knowledgebase</h4>
<p>The website is responsive for users on both mobile and desktop.  The back end of the website is setup so that certain sections can be easily changed by the client with no coding involved. Examples are the Programs, Community Impact, and Blog sections. The page headings can also be changed from the back end of the website allowing for quick and easy changes. </p>

<p>The use of SASS allowed for the creation of variables and mixins to greatly reduce the amount of CSS that needed to be written. </p>
<p>JQuery is used to dynamically bring the pop up hamburger menu on the mobile version of the website. </p>
<p>BxSlider is used for slider in the Programs page. A jquery plugin that helps display the programs in a slider.</p>
<p>PHP is used to create custom loops and for utilizing Custom Field Suite for content and files. This allows the user to input images
and content at specific locations of the site.</p>
<p>Contact Form 7 wordpress plugin is used to create the form on the Contact page. A separate plugin, Contact Form 7 Success Page Redirects, is used to display a welcome page once the contact form has been successfully submitted.</p>
<p>Images were resized to ensure quick load times for pages and minimal data usage on the mobile site.</p>
<p>Evenly sized commits were made to github by each member working on the website to ensure that backup copies are properly saved at different points that can be reverted back to if need be. </p>
